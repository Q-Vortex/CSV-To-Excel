# CSV-To-Excel
CSV-To-Excel is a simple and efficient program built with Node.js and Python that helps you quickly convert CSV files into XLSX format

## How to Download
1. Clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Q-Vortex/CSV-To-Excel.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `build` folder.
3. Run the executable (`.exe`) file.
## Rebuilding the Executable
If something happens to the `.exe` file, you can quickly rebuild it.

- In the root folder of the project, you will find special installer scripts:
  - `installer.sh` for Linux
  - `installer.bat` for Windows

On Linux, everything is automated.

For Windows, if you don't have Git, Node.js, or Python installed, the script will download installers into the `installers` folder.  
You will need to run these installers one by one manually.

Simply place all your CSV and XLSX files in the same folder as the executable.  
The program will automatically detect them.
